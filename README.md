# Bird API

This is a portfolio project I did as part of my full stack engineer course on [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com). It is an API that allows birds to be queried from a large database. The response from the API contains the characteristics of the bird species and whether or not that bird can be transported abroad (i.e. the bird's "permissions").


## Server
### Requirements
- Build a functioning REST API using C# and .net
- Allow CRUD operations on entities - GET permissions, POST permissions (PUT and DELETE tbc)
- Document the API using Swagger. Use best practices for the Design of the endpoints as described in this [Swagger blogpost](https://swagger.io/blog/api-design/api-design-best-practices/) 

### How it was built
#### Base libraries/techonolgies
- [DOTNET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) - Microsoft dotnet framework

## Features
This is a multi-page app (MPA) with a basic design that is accessible from desktop, tablet and mobile devices with all modern browsers, with Lighthouse scores of 70 for performance, 97 for accessibility, 92 for best practices, and 100 for SEO (full report can be viewed by [clicking here](./readme/wpt-lighthouse.pdf), while a JSON of the app's [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) run can be viewed by [clicking here](./readme/wpt-result.json)).
